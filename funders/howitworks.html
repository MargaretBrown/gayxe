								I want to pitch a project. What do I do?
							</p>
							<p>
								If you have an idea and the passion to start a project, and need money to make it work, funders.my is the place for you.
							</p>
							<p>
						1.	 Identify the category that fits your project i.e _______________________________________<br>
						2.	 Define your project, give it a focus. It's got to have a clear beginning with finite ending. An example is writing a book. The project finishes when you publish the book.<br>
						3.	 Know how much money you need to raise. This will be your funding goal. And don't forget to set a deadline of between 30 and 60 days to pitch your project on funders.my. (Do remember to factor in the 5% funders.my's and 3.5% PayPal's fees when you draw up your costing).<br>
						4.	 Identify a series creative and interesting rewards for people who are going to make financial pledges to your project. Make the rewards worth their while (and the money they pledge).<br>
						5.	 And finally - Send your idea to us at pitch@funders.my.my. Every submission will get a response. That is our promise to you.<br>

								What happens when my project is live on funders.my?
							</p>
							<p>
								This is when your campaign (and fun) begins. Tell your friends and families about your project and encourage, persuade, cajole, make a case for them to support you by making a pledge. Create your publicity drive using various social media tools to get the word out.
							</p>
							<p>
								Monitor the progress of your project at funders.my, and check for users' feedback and engage with them.

						</div>
						
						<div class="tab-content" data-tab-id="3">
							<p class="lead">
								How do I make visitors to funders.my pledge to my project?
							</p>
							<p>
								We figure people will make a pledge to your project because:
							</p>
							<p>
								1.	They like the idea behind your project enough to support it by making a financial pledge.<br>
								2.	Interesting and inspiring REWARDS that you offer.<br>
								3.	Your passion as told in your story in your campaign. Projects at funders.my are labour of love by people doing something they are passionate about. Tell them your story, your passion and people may respond to that.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="tab-content" data-tab-id="4">
							<p class="lead">
								What can I offer as a reward?
							</p>
							<p>
								Preferably, items produced by your projects - a copy of a book that you want to publish; CD of your film; special edition prints; limited edition tee-shirts with your project design on it.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, there are items that cannot be offered as rewards like lotteries, coupons, discounts, alcohol etc. Please see the Project Guidelines for details.

							Funding is for creative projects only - A project has a clear goal, like publishing a book, or producing a music album; that will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it. A project has a deadline. Launching an acting career is not a project.

							<br><br>No "fund my life" projects - You cannot raise funds at funders.my to pay for your colleges fees or bills, go on vacation, or buy that watch that you always wanted.
							<br><br>No prohibited items or subject matter - There are things that are not allowed here on funders.my which includes things like alcohol, drugs, pornography, and others. Please see the list of prohibited items/subject matter.
